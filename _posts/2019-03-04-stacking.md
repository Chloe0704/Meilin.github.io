How to find the best model is a hard question. So, instead of making the either-or decision, we can choose another option -- combing those model together to achieve a better performance, and this is called stacking.
By utilizing feature selection and stacking, this notebook uses weather data from Kaggle to explore how to predict whether tomorrow will rain based on today's weather information.

Stacking is an ensemble learning technique to combine multiple classification models via a meta-classifier. The individual classification models are trained based on the complete training set; then, the meta-classifier is fitted based on the outputs -- meta-features -- of the individual classification models in the ensemble.
